XHTML2ODT - XHTML to ODT XML transformation
===========================================

These stylesheets convert namespaced HTML to ODT.

The HTML may be included in an ODT document, the ODT will be left untouched.


Caveats
-------

Styles: the styles are not added to the document. After converting to ODT, you
must go through the styles used in the document and add the needed styles.
Templates for those styles are provided in the "styles" subdirectory. If a
style has a "display-name" property, it must be added to styles.xml. Otherwise
it must be added to the automatic-styles section of content.xml.

Images: images are not added, you must manually go trough the draw:image
elements in the converted ODT text and use the xlink:href attribute to download
or copy the image. While you're at it, you should update the image dimensions
if the were not provided in the img tag.


Tests
-----
The unit tests are python-based, you need to install the "nose" python module
availble from PyPI (or your distribution).

Then, just run "nosetests tests"
